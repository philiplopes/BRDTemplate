# BRDTemplate
This is a very basic BRD template that I follow to first build a skeleton and then add on to it once the Change Request Document is created.
I then take into consideration the following points into a BRD.
Porject overview.
Success factors.
Porject scope.
Stakeholder identification.
Business reuqirements.
Project constraints.
Quality control measures.
